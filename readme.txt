== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder `dessky-responsive-slider` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" page in WordPress. 
3. After activating a new menu item "Slides" would appear under "Pages". 
4. Go to **Slides -> Settings** and configure the slider options.
5. Go to **Slides -> Add New Slide** and create couple of slides.
6. For using slider in the theme itself place `<?php do_shortcode( '[dessky_responsive_slider]' ); ?>` . Alternatively you can use **[dessky_responsive_slider]** into a post or a page - just like any other shortcode, or you can use shortcode slider button at the top of the content editor.
 
That's it. Your site should now display the slider at the chosen location.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Would the Dessky Responsive Slider work in my theme? =

The plugin has been tested with more than 40 popular WordPress themes. It should work in yours too.

= Does my theme need to be 'responsive' in order to use this plugin? =

No, not at all. You can use it with any theme.

= Can I change the way it looks? =

You can easily override the slider CSS in your theme. The fastest approach is to use a tool like Firebug to find the snippet you need to override. Then copy it to your theme CSS file (usually 'style.css') and edit it there, using a CSS selector with higher priority.

= Can I create more than one slider? =
No, currently the plugin can create only one slider.
